# Walkthrough
Hello Guyz,
Today, Here I am going to share with you my walkthrough exploitation research, tools Stuff and Exploit That Can help you in completing Exploit-Exercise Protostar Level.

Basically, My Goal is Just to provide you hints, so that you can Understand all concepts on your own.

But If still after reading this hint post, you are not understanding concepts clearly and want to see Exploit Code And Other Details then you can visit my blog posts. [click here](http://www.bitforestinfo.com/2018/05/binary-exploitation-protostar-format4.html)


    
# Source Code

{% highlight c %}


#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int target;

void hello()
{
  printf("code execution redirected! you win\n");
  _exit(1);
}

void vuln()
{
  char buffer[512];

  fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);

  printf(buffer);

  exit(1);   
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  vuln();
}



{% endhighlight %}


# Hints



{% highlight bash %}


%p format4 looks at one method of redirecting execution in a process.

Hints

    objdump -TR is your friend

This level is at /opt/protostar/bin/format4

{% endhighlight %}




# Plan

{% highlight bash %}


As we know:
     printf family function can be exploit with format string vulnerability if programmer don't used these function carefully.

    | String Buffer                            |

Step 1:
    --------------------------------------------
    |  AAAAAA %x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x          |
    --------------------------------------------
	%x will print arguments from the top of stack
	check exact padding between the starting of our string Onto the top of stack through printf vulnerability %x

Step 2:
	%5$x : Here, $ sign helps in selecting exact index of string. so, we can use this advantage.
	%5$n : n, expression can write number of bytes onto pointing address.
	
    --------------------------------------------
    |  Address1, Address2 %number_of_bytesx%1$n %number_of_bytesx%2$n          |
    --------------------------------------------
