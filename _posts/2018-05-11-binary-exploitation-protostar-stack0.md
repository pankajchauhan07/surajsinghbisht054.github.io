# Walkthrough
Hello Guyz,
Today, Here I am going to share with you my walkthrough exploitation research, tools Stuff and Exploit That Can help you in completing Exploit-Exercise Protostar Level.

Basically, My Goal is Just to provide you hints, so that you can Understand all concepts on your own.

But If still after reading this hint post, you are not understanding concepts clearly and want to see Exploit Code And Other Details then you can visit my blog posts. [click here](http://www.bitforestinfo.com/2018/04/binary-exploitation-protostar-stack0.html)


    
# Source Code

{% highlight c %}

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}


{% endhighlight %}


# Hints



{% highlight bash %}

This level introduces the concept that memory can be accessed outside of its allocated region, how the stack variables are laid out, and that modifying outside of the allocated memory can modify program execution.

This level is at /opt/protostar/bin/stack0

                                                                      to stack so That it will work as a argument for get command.

   0x804840c <main+24>:	call   0x804830c <gets@plt>             <<=== Perform Get Command
   0x8048411 <main+29>:	mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x5c]         <<=== Get Value Of 92-96 bits and move it to EAX register
